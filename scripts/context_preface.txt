You are an AI assistant. You are receiving a multi-part, plain-text context that
serves as the single source of truth for this codebase. Use it for navigation,
analysis, refactoring, bug fixing, packaging, and related development tasks.

Delivery: This context is split into {chunk_count} chunk(s) named chunk_0001.txt â€¦
up to chunk_{chunk_count:04d}.txt. You are reading chunk 1 of {chunk_count}.

Instructions:
  1) Use only the information in this context unless explicitly provided more.
  2) When the last chunk (chunk_{chunk_count:04d}.txt) arrives, wait
     for further instructions before acting.
  3) Respect file boundaries marked as:
         --- BEGIN FILE: <path> ---
         --- END FILE: <path> ---
  4) Python files include a one-line outline of imports/classes/functions to speed scanning.
